# More SlashBlade Ex Enchantment Effects

An addon mod for SlashBlade: Resharped that greatly expands the enchantment system of Slash Blades, giving each sword a
unique combat style.

# Introduction

SlashBlade: Resharped's original enchantment enhancement system only includes Soul Speed and Feather Falling, which is
clearly insufficient on the path of pursuing ultimate combat in the Shura realms.

This mod adds a large number of additional enchantment enhancement effects to Slash Blades, allowing them to use almost
every enchantment that exists in vanilla Minecraft. From armor-type enchantments that enhance defense, to weapon-type
enchantments that change the performance of shooting arts, to special enchantments adapted to specific
environments—every sword swing will be filled with infinite possibilities.

Through carefully combining these enchantment enhancement effects, you can create the perfect sword tailored to your own
combat style. Whether you're a Summoned Sword master focused on ranged combat or a sword art expert proficient in
close-quarters combat, you'll find the most suitable enchantment combination for yourself.
